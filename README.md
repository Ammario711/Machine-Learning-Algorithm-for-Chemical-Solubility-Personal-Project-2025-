# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Chemical-Solubility-Personal-Project-2025-
A fully self-directed end‑to‑end project: sourced and cleaned a public dataset, engineered features, built and tuned a regression model, and evaluated performance with robust preprocessing and cross‑validation. Visualized results for interpretability using a Scikit‑learn pipeline.


My role and contributions: Fully self-directed end-to-end project. I sourced and cleaned a public dataset (e.g., from PubChem or ESOL benchmark), engineered features (molecular descriptors via RDKit if extended, but core used basic physicochemical properties), built and tuned a regression model, evaluated performance, and visualized results for interpretability.
Here is the core modeling pipeline (Python with Scikit-learn). I focused on preprocessing robustness and cross-validation for reliable predictions.
