# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Chemical-Solubility-Personal-Project-2025-
A fully self-directed end‑to‑end project: sourced and cleaned a public dataset, engineered features, built and tuned a regression model, and evaluated performance with robust preprocessing and cross‑validation. Visualized results for interpretability using a Scikit‑learn pipeline.
